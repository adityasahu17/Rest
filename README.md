--UserRestService.java is the Rest Controller. I would prefer to maintain a DAO layer with Interface but as we are not making connection 
	to any Database so I skiped that. Also,

--UserRestServiceTest.java is the JUnit test cases.

--Web.xml I have used xml configuration for sevelet rather than Annotation because I believe it is always helpful to look for a configuration
	in XML then in java.
